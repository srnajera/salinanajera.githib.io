# About Me
Hello! I'm Salina, a passionate Data Science graduate student committed to turning complex data into actionable insights that drive strategic business decisions. With a keen analytical mindset and a strong foundation in statistical methods and machine learning, I am on a quest to unlock the stories hidden within data.

## My Journey
I ventured into the realm of data science out of a profound curiosity for understanding patterns and a desire to solve real-world problems through quantitative analysis. My academic journey has been a blend of rigorous coursework, practical projects, and collaborative learning, all of which have equipped me with a deep understanding of data science principles and practices.

## Skills and Expertise
Here's a snapshot of the skills I've honed during my graduate studies:
- **Programming Proficiency:** Proficient in Python and R for data analysis, with hands-on experience in SQL for database management.
- **Machine Learning:** Trained in building predictive models using various algorithms, from linear regression to complex ensemble methods.
- **Data Visualization:** Skilled in creating intuitive visualizations that convey complex data findings using tools like Tableau and libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
- **Big Data Technologies:** Familiar with big data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop.
- **Communication:** Effective communicator capable of translating technical findings into strategic insights for technical and non-technical audiences alike.

## What I Bring to the Table
I blend academic knowledge with project experience, showcasing my ability to not only analyze data but to also implement solutions that can bring about innovation and efficiency. Through my graduate projects, I've explored areas like predictive analytics, natural language processing, and time series analysis, all while emphasizing ethical considerations in data handling and analysis.

I am always eager to collaborate on projects that challenge me to push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills. If you're looking for someone who is as curious about the questions as the answers, I'd love to connect!

## Featured Project: Hospital Financial Data Analysis

### Overview
Embarked on an analytical journey to understand the financial landscape of hospitals in California, this project leverages a comprehensive dataset to uncover patterns, predict net income, and explore financial disparities between urban and rural hospitals.

### Highlights
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Insight into key metrics like net income and operational hours, revealing significant variability.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Financial disparities between Riverside (rural) and Los Angeles (urban) counties.
- **Regression Analysis:** Predictability of nurse staffing levels with an R-squared value of 0.919.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Positive correlation between net income and total operating expenses.
